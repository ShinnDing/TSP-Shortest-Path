DelivB assignment summary:  Find the shortest bitonic tour of the cities from westernmost city to easternmost city and back to westernmost city.  The “val” field of the test                               file lists a floating point number that indicates either the latitude or longitude of the city. Output the distance of the shortest bitonic tour,                               and the order of cities in the tour.

DelivC assignment summary:  From the starting city (val = “S”) use depth first search with iterative deepening to find the nearest goal city (val = “G”).  Start with a depth                               bound of 1, and increase the depth bound by 1 each time through the graph.  Print out your results for each depth bound that causes a change over                               the previous depth bound.  

DelivD assignment summary:  Find the best possible Hamiltonian Cycle of a given graph in the test files, from specified start "S" to goal "G" cities, using an algorithm from                               Sections 4.7 – 4.9 of the Poole & Mackworth text, or a combination of algorithms. Print the initial path, and every path found that is the better                               than all previous paths.  Create edges between cities where none exists.  Do not use Dynamic Programming.

Report assignment summary:  Write a report that explains what you did.  Indicate the algorithm you chose, and any parameters you used for it.  Explain why you chose to attack                               the problem the way you did.  The explanation should be detailed enough to look at the code and follow what you did.  Discuss the goodness of the                               results you seemed to get.
